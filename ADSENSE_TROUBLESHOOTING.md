# AdSense Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Error: "No slot size for availableWidth=45"

This error occurs when Google AdSense can't determine the appropriate ad size for the available space. Here's how to fix it:

## üîß Immediate Fix Applied

I've updated your `GoogleAdSense.tsx` component with the following improvements:

### 1. **Better Error Detection**
- Added validation for placeholder ad slot IDs
- Shows helpful error messages in development mode
- Prevents loading ads with invalid configurations

### 2. **Improved Container Sizing** 
- Added `minHeight` to prevent zero-height containers
- Better responsive sizing logic
- Proper DOM timing to ensure containers are ready

### 3. **Development Mode Support**
- Shows visual placeholders with error information
- Displays which ad slots need real IDs
- Helps identify configuration issues

## üö® Required Actions

### Step 1: Get Real AdSense Ad Unit IDs

You're currently using placeholder IDs that won't work:
- `"1234567890"` (Header)
- `"5555555555"` (Between Articles) 
- `"9876543210"` (Sidebar)

**To get real IDs:**

1. Go to [Google AdSense Console](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Navigate to **Ads > By ad unit**
3. Create these ad units:

```
Header Banner:
- Type: Display ad
- Size: Responsive (728x90 recommended)
- Name: "Header Banner"

Sidebar Rectangle:
- Type: Display ad  
- Size: 300x250 (Medium Rectangle)
- Name: "Sidebar Rectangle"

Between Articles:
- Type: Display ad
- Size: Responsive (horizontal format)
- Name: "Between Articles"
```

4. Copy each ad unit's slot ID (looks like `"1234567890"`)

### Step 2: Update Your Code

Replace the placeholder IDs in these files:

**src/components/HomePageClient.tsx:**
```tsx
// Line 285
<AdSenseHeader adSlot="YOUR_REAL_HEADER_SLOT_ID" />

// Line 474  
adSlot="YOUR_REAL_BETWEEN_ARTICLES_SLOT_ID"

// Line 521
<AdSenseSidebar adSlot="YOUR_REAL_SIDEBAR_SLOT_ID" />
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional)

For better configuration management, add to `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HEADER_SLOT=your_header_slot_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_SIDEBAR_SLOT=your_sidebar_slot_id  
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_BETWEEN_ARTICLES_SLOT=your_between_articles_slot_id
```

Then update your components:
```tsx
<AdSenseHeader adSlot={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HEADER_SLOT || "fallback_id"} />
```

## üîç Current Component Features

### Development Mode
- Shows error messages instead of broken ads
- Displays slot IDs for debugging
- Visual placeholders with dashed borders

### Production Mode
- Gracefully handles missing configuration
- Won't render if client ID missing
- Better error logging

### Responsive Design

3. **After setup:** Real ads should load without errors

## üöÄ Additional AdSense Tips

### Approval Requirements
- Site needs substantial original content
- Must comply with AdSense policies  
- Can take 24-48 hours for approval

### Performance Optimization
- Ads load asynchronously (already implemented)
- Proper lazy loading for better Core Web Vitals

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

1. **Check AdSense Console** for policy violations
2. **Verify site ownership** in AdSense
3. **Ensure adequate content** (news articles help!)
4. **Wait for approval** if account is new

The updated component will show you exactly what's wrong, making debugging much easier!
